2. cd into the new folder
3. run `bundle install`
4. create the development and test databases in postgresql
5. run `rails db:migrate` to run migrations on database
6. run `npm install`

## Planning

I used the github wiki to plan the project and track my progress:
- [User Stories](https://github.com/stringiest/all_i_want_for/wiki/02.-MVP-&-User-Stories) drive features
- [Entity Relationship Diagramming](https://github.com/stringiest/all_i_want_for/wiki/03.-Diagramming) helped plan out the database structure
- I created a list of aspirations for [future features](https://github.com/stringiest/all_i_want_for/wiki/06.-Future-Features)
